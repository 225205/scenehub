          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
              <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #952735;"></span>
                  #952735
                  <em>The dark red colour refers to the iconic curtain that are always present on theatre stages, that are of course, the ultimate goal of every actor&hellip;</em>
                </li>
				  				                  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #dc3545;"></span>
                  #DC3545 
                  <em>This bright red color colour stands out above the other red colors, and adds perfectly to the color palette. It is used to highlight call-to-actions&hellip;</em>
                </li>
				                  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #dc7986;"></span>
                  #DC7986 
                  <em>The light red colour refers is the perfect color of red to use for bsckgrounds and further enhance the idea of classic theatre.&hellip;</em>
                </li>
				                  <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E6e6e6;"></span>
                  #E6E6E6
                  <em>This white-grey color is used as an alternative to white, to give further highlights to specific elements or pages. The color is also often found as the color of walls of practice rooms for acting&hellip;</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FFFFFF;"></span>
                  #FFFFFF
                  <em>This basic white color is the finaling touch of the color palette, which fits perfect with the fading red palette. Creating a great contrast between footer and the page.&hellip;</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For our fonts, we decided to stick to sans-serif. We wish to create a simple, but modern website, with no fancy or too "extra" fonts. The sans-serif gives a modern and slick design to our website, which we thought fits perfectly</li>
            <li>For our interface patterns, we kept the menu small and easy to use. The landing page only consisting of a large gif with a big call to action. On the products page, a carousel with some stock free images that represent the ideas of our platform. Lastly, the cards below the carousel, which represents a for-you page, with all trending videos of this week, together with a call-to-action to view them.</li>
            <li>Because of the few amount of pages, we made the page titles clear, with all relevent content in those specific pages. All information regarding the company are in the company info page (values, who we are and info on our values), and in our product, the idea of our product platform homepage, and all marketing and management content in the corporate page.</li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>Our website fits the personality and values of our brand, as we wish to create something that is accessible to all. We tried to create the website as simplistic and streamlined as we could, as we wish the procedure to join our platform should be. Alongside that, one of our values is to bring community, and with the images we have chosen, we believe this idea comes greatly across.</li>
                <li>The video fits the marketing campaign, as the style with colors is the same, and because the target age is between 20-30 years old, a rather young target age, who have experience with more modern websites that are often aided with visuals like pictures, like ours.</li>
                <li>Our unique value proposition is that we have an app where we combine multiple elements into one single platform. One of these elements is the possiblity to post video's, which is what we created in our product page, where a sort of for-you page is shown, with all trending video's. Furthermore, we tried to emphasize the idea of a community platform as much as we could all over our website, together with call-to-action buttons.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please write about&hellip;</p>
          <ul>
			  <li>For our <strong>testing goals</strong>, we wanted to see what people's first thoughts were on our website, if the interface was clear and straight forward, if our brand idea was clear, and if there was anything unclear about the site at all.</li>
            <li>For our <strong> testing methods</strong>, we:
              <ul>
                <li>Conducted tests with <strong>16 participants</strong>, most relevant to our target audience (actors & people with experience in theatre), and a few people outside of our target audience, purely for the purpose to see if these specific participants had more difficulty understanding our brand idea.
                <li>All test <strong>settings</strong> were done in person, either on school, on location with an interviewee, or at home. Lastly, no further materials were used other than our own laptops.
                <li>The test <strong>protocols</strong> were all straight forward instructions. We started every test at the landing page, and asked our participant to either go to the product page or company info page, not by asking directly, but indirectly, for example: "Where would you find the values of our company?" or "where do I find the videos uploaded by users of our platform?". All tests were recorded on our phones.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your testing <strong>results</strong> show:
              <ul>
                <li>+ clear and straight forward user interface</li>
				 <li>+ clear and recognizable style</li>
				  <li>+ good user experience with the carousel, images and gifs.</li>
				  <li>- what we provide as a brand not immediately understood</li>
				  <li>- some elements thought to be on other pages</li>
                <li>To improve our site, we changed some text to more clearly state our brand ideas and what we provide. Improvements that would be added (but not due to complexion) are for example: a more refined and detailed product page, together with a page for your own profile, a page for the feedback hub and page to send audition videos directly to producers.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

			<h6>Target audience</h6>
			<p>
			Our target audience focuses on amateur actors in theatre, between the ages of 18 – 28. Our target group uses the multiple social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook for communication, but also to keep themselves updated with the latest news from their favorite theatre plays. For auditioning, they use a few platforms, such as CastProApp and Typisch. They love to watch audition tapes, read scripts, and practice theatre alone in their room. They either already do acting classes but seek to improve more as they are unfulfilled with their current progress in their craft, or have little experience acting and can’t afford classes and love to practice scripts and scenes in their room. They are unsure of which casting platforms are safe and good to use for optimal opportunities as an actor. 
			</p>
			<h6>Communication objectives</h6>
			<p>
			Our objective is to reach 1.000- 2.500 on social media who view our account by April 5th, which is measured through the insights on the Instagram business account. In terms of who actually engage with our profile, we want to reach 100 to 200 people by April 5th. The goal is to make these people feel hopeful, motivated, and excited. These will be measured through analysing comments to see if our emotional objectives have been achieved based on their reactions. We want to give them the drive they need to keep going in their acting career, and give a good place for them to grow. The response we hope to get from our audience is a call to action and download and try out our servicer. The hope for our audience to regularly use it as their main source of casting calls and acting feedback. This way we can get participants to be able to receive, and give out feedback to others. Furthermore, we hope they will share the app with their actor colleagues, and friends, setting a chain reaction in motion where possibly acting schools can propose to use our apps for feedback among peers. 
			</p>
		  <p>
          Our SMART goal is to reach between 1.000 to 2.500 people on social media before 5 April, by posting regularly on social media and by measuring our Instagram account statistics.  
		  </p>
		  <h6>Media tactics</h6>	
		  <p>
		  The main platforms we will use to promote our brand are Instagram and Facebook as it is already used by actors to connect with one another. Facebook has Facebook groups for different communities including theatre communities, where we can reach multiple groups at the same time and promote through these groups. Instagram is also a platform largely popular for the younger generation, whereas facebook is used more for professional connections, and community.  	
		  </p>
		  <h6>Planning</h6>
		  <p>
		  There is a combination of light-hearted video reels and photos with professional information about the app which provides a well-balanced promotion technique that attracts the younger audience with the easy-to-consume content, and is easy to process as well as provides a professional formal look into the brand to look trustworthy and sophisitcated. </p>
          <p>
	      The formal posts will be posted on the main feed for the professional trustworthy look, whereas the light hearted reels are posted in the reel category mostly to attract the younger audience and help with exposure. Ocasionally the posts will be placed on the story to ensure that the audience is exposed to the content.  
		  </p>
		  <h6>Positioning</h6>
		  <p>
		  The way how we position ourselves uniquely from the competition is by providing a platform which combines multiple functionalities into one. Providing a hub where actors can improve their acting, connect with other actors, upload their resume, and send audition videos through casting calls available for an easy streamline system of auditioning. A sort of LinkedIn, specifically for actors who wish to grow and learn.

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points & Reflection</h4>
		  <p>
		  Our communication plan could have been improved a lot more. We have learned a lot throughout the experience, which can be taken further into the future. Some elements that have been learned throughout this experience is that we could have started posting way sooner as it would have provided more time to create an audience and get noticed on the platform. Furthermore, the professionality of the posts could have been more apparent on the social media accounts. We received feedback which enlightened us that by posting an unbalanced amount of funny and catchy meme videos, the brand easily appeared unprofessional and could not be taken seriously. Our posts did not provide enough of an insight into the professional aspect of the brand. Therefore, we changed our posts to 60/40% professional and casual content. We would pay more attention to this and reflect on whether we are achieving what we want to portray with our posts.  Additionally, the overall look of the posts was initially not following the style guide that was set for the brand. There were posts with purple in it which threw off the look of the brand. We easily fixed this by changing the cover of the video which is visible on the feed of the social media platform. Next time we would apply the style guide sooner and pay more attention to it. This way the feed looks more professional, as does our brand. Lastly, we encountered some issues with the verification of our Facebook account which was rejected due to not being able to identify a face. Through this setback we could not reach more people through Facebook. In the future when an issue such as this one occurs, we would either take more time to solve the problem or find another platform to promote our brand on, to not jeopardise our possible reach. 
		  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If we were to continue this project, we would broaden our reach to more online platforms such as TikTok as it is easy to reach a large audience there and TikTok is a platform largely used by our target audience. We could also see how we could resolve the Facebook issue and continue our posts there as well as start to reach out personally to theatre Facebook groups and communities. As of the content itself, we would incorporate more personal experiences of users such as ‘day in the life’ and a ‘review’ of their experience with Scenehub. The professional posts would continue as well as the more casual ones. The reels could follow more trends that fit our target audience and we would try to incorporate them as businesslike as possible. Furthermore, we would start doing some offline marketing such as posters and flyers. Lastly, we would start to provide workshops around acting and theatre at theatres and acting schools to promote our expertise and service.

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The need for feedback for amateur actors</li>
			<li>Amateur actors without theatre education wanting to make it pro</li>
			<li>A lack of community between actors</li>
			  <hr>
            <p>During our first problem interviews, we got some interesting insights into the needs of amateur actors in theatre. But one issue that stood out for us was the need for feedback amateur actors have. One of the interviewees we spoke to told us it is usual that, if you do not get a role, you just receive a rejection without an explanation of why you did not get the role. Also, some of the interviewees told us they did feel there was a community feeling amongst actors once they worked together, but outside of that, there are no suitable platforms to get in contact with other actors. 
			</p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A platform where actors can upload video’s to other actors to receive feedback on it before sending it to a casting.  </li>
			  <hr>
			  <p>Our interviewees said they would like to receive feedback on their casting videos and are willing to give feedback to others if there is a platform for it. We started working on the idea of making a platform where actors can give and receive feedback on roles or casting videos they post. Also, the actors we spoke to told us they missed an easy-to-use platform to find castings and get in contact with directors and producers. This is why we worked on a feature for producers to upload their castings to our app as well.  
			   </p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>20-30 year old Dutch amateur actors, actors that want to improve their acting, and even want to make it their profession. Also, production companies looking for new, up and coming actors.</li>
            <li>Persona:</li>
			  <p> Delilah White is an 21 year old, Amsterdam living amateur actor. Her hobbies are singing, dancing, acting and visiting theatre. Her motivations are teambonding, escapism, creativity and evoking emotions. She studies English literature at the Frank Sanders Akademie. Her experience is acting in school plays and as extras in movies & series. Her life goals are to impact peoples lives with beautiful acting and also act in nation wide plays.

			  </p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You could see our brand and service as a LinkedIn for actors.  Scenehub is a platform where actors can connect with other actors and producers. As an addition to the community feature, we allow users to upload photos and videos on which they can give and receive feedback. By doing this they can improve their acting skills and have a higher chance to get roles and jobs in the acting world.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One of the challenges we will have to face is the amount of users that we need to make the app usable. We’ll need a significant amount of users to make sure that enough people post videos and enough people give feedback on those videos. Of course, these users cannot be bought and will have to download our app out of free will. This challenge can be tackled by having a good marketing strategy. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instagram, Facebook, and offline marketing: billboards and workshops.</li>
			  <hr>
            <p>We will try to reach our target audience via Instagram and Facebook. And with offline advertising with billboards close to theatres and rehearsal spaces. And by collaborating with amateur theatre productions, for instance by giving workshops. </p>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Of course, numbers and data are very important to see how our brand is doing. The numbers that will be most important to our brand will be: The amount of users our app has, and what percentage of users are active users. Active users are users who use our service more than twice a week. Also, the amount of followers and views we have on our social media are important indications of how our target audience is responding to our marketing content.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our brand will make money by allowing companies to advertise on our app. Also, actors can advertise their videos so they get more responses to their posts. And finally when a producer has uploaded a casting call on our app, and gets in contact with an actor via our app, they will have to pay for the service we have provided.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The fixed costs our brand will have to deal with are mostly employee costs. We’ll need admins and technical experts to keep our websites up-to-date and working. Also, there will be some variable costs in the marketing process. For instance, the making and producing of social media posts, and the offline advertising with billboards and workshops. </li>
            <li>Calculate the cost per unit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our service offers a platform for ambitious actors who would like to receive feedback on their casting videos. And getting them in contact with producers and directors of professional productions. 

 

This service fits the excitement and community that we like to pursue with our brand. </li>
            <li>Clarify the fit between the product/service developed and the brand identity/brand image.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>The Scenehub team has chosen its Trademark because there are not a lot of alternatives available for the users. Our trademark is a platform where actors can upload videos of their acting, so they can receive feedback from other actors. For instance, if they want to use a video for a certain casting in the industry, but they are not sure about the video. </p> 

		  <p>
          Platforms that are alternatives for our users could be LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a platform that professionals can use to get in contact with employees, and vice versa. LinkedIn is a fairly formal platform that is purely based on professional connections in all kinds of employment. Our platform will focus on Actors and the creative industry. Also, our platform will provide a digital safe space, where actors can give and receive feedback and build communities. Those are features that are not available on platforms such as LinkedIn. </p>
